# Candidate Classification System

This repository contains a machine learning classification model designed to categorize candidates based on various factors such as experience level, technical specialization, education background, project experience, communication skills, and other relevant attributes. The goal is to assist in candidate screening and evaluation processes by predicting candidate categories (e.g., Good Fit, Average Fit, Not Suitable) using different classification algorithms.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

The following machine learning classification algorithms were implemented and compared for performance:

- 🌳 **Random Forest Classifier**
- 🤖 **Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier**
- 📈 **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- 📍 **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

## 🧾 Features Considered

The model uses various candidate-related features including:

- Experience Level
- Age & Gender
- Leadership Experience
- Salary Expectation
- Communication & Collaboration Skills
- Soft Skills & Personality Traits

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

Each model was evaluated using standard classification metrics such as:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

## 🛠 Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
